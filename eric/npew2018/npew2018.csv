We are fortunate that our Quebec-grown wild blueberries do not require any insecticide or fungicide applications whatsoever during the harvest year. This results in a commercially grown conventional wild berry which is truly 100% pesticide-free. This represents a unique feature among North American wild blueberry growing regions. In addition, we also harvest organically-certified wild blueberries which are exported world-wide as frozen (IQF) as well as infused-dried. Our infused-dried wild blueberries are all Non-GMO Project Verified, and our products contain only 3 ingredients, namely the fruit itself, the sweetener (non-GMO cane sugar or apple juice).

"Just Thrive Probiotic",4643,"http://www.thriveprobiotic.com","Park Ridge,  IL, United States","DMS Natural Health, LLC is proud to introduce the next generation of probiotics in Just Thrive Probiotic & Antioxidant. Just Thrive Probiotic & Antioxidant is the first and only probiotic that actually arrives alive in the small intestine and produces an array of potent antioxidants! A probiotic is NOT a probiotic unless it arrives at the site of action (the intestines) alive, where it goes to work providing its probiotic benefits. Just Thrive survives the harsh conditions of the stomach 100% and arrives alive in the intestines - and it does this naturally without enteric coating. Once arriving in the intestines, these strains begin to colonize to promote better digestive health. Researchers have found that the body's naturally harsh stomach acid destroys 99.99% of the major types of probiotics long before those products could even arrive in the small intestine. The strains in Just Thrive are robust enough to naturally survive the stomach acid. These strains are backed by research with scientifically proven benefits - and have created a paradigm shift in the basic understanding of probiotic therapy. The bacillus strains used in Just Thrive are spore-forming bacteria with the unique ability to read the microbial environment. These strains can actually identify pathogenic organisms within the gut and produce antibiotics to kill them. In addition, these strains identify the 'friendly' bacteria and produce compounds and nutrients to help promote good bacteria. Essentially, these strains act as a gardener of the gut - they help grow the good plants and help eliminate the weeds in the gut. Rather than re-seeding the gut, these strains re-condition the gut. In addition to being an extremely effective and result-oriented probiotic, Just Thrive does something else very special. The Bacillus indicus probiotic strain in Just Thrive produces antioxidant carotenoids in the intestines. A full array of carotenoids (alpha and beta carotene, CoQ10, lycopene, lutein, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin) are produced in the intestines exactly where they need to be absorbed - making this the most bioavailable form of antioxidants! Further, the strains in Just Thrive create an increase in short chain fatty acid production by up to 40%, which is optimal for colon health and protection. Research shows that these strains cause up to a 30% favorable shift in the microbiota - illustrating that they may actually fix dysbiosis in the gut. This is game-changing! Just Thrive Probiotc & Antioxidant is the result of a 6-year collaboration with Dr. Simon Cutting from Royal Holloway University of London. Dr. Cutting's findings and research have had a remarkable effect on the understanding of probiotics and probiotic therapies.","antioxidant formulas, children's supplements, immune support, digestive aids, digestive health, enzyme products, nutritional supplements, vitamin supplements","Just Thrive Probiotic & Antioxidant"

"MatchaBar","N1539","http://www.matchabarnyc.com","Brooklyn,  NY, United States","MatchaBar is a Matcha tea company based in New York, founded by brothers Max & Graham Fortgang. In September of 2014, we opened up America's first Matcha cafe in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with a simple mission: to bring Matcha to the people. Our company is built upon a simple proverb: Good Things Come To Those Who Hustle. Our brand culture is built around hard work, dedication, and team work. MatchaBar proudly serves our own brand of Matcha sourced directly from farming partners in Nishio, Japan. MatchaBar is known for taking Matcha in new and exciting directions, creating a menu of signature beverages such as our Fuji Apple Ginger Matcha, Iced Vanilla Almond Matcha Latte, and more. In our first summer, we focused on unconventional marketing experiences, bringing the MatchaBar experience in pop-up form to cities as far as LA and Tokyo, and locally, to music festivals, hackathons, college campuses, and special events like TED Talks. With our brand proverb in mind, we go above and beyond to continue to foster our community, what we call our MatchaFam. In the Fall of 2015, we opened a second location in the heart of Chelsea, bringing MatchaBar to Manhattan! MatchaBar is now positioned as the most visible Matcha brand in the United States.So what's next? In January 2016, we will launch our line of ready-to-drink products, MatchaBar Iced Matcha Tea. After over 18 months of development, we launched to market exclusive in Whole Foods New York with three of our cafe's signature flavors: Fuji Apple Ginger, Peach and Original. MatchaBar: Iced Matcha Tea is shelf stable and packaged in a 10oz premium glass bottle. Each bottle will contain a 2-gram serving of our ceremonial grade Matcha, deliver a calm, focused energy with 80mg of natural caffeine!","functional beverages, tea","MatchaBar: Iced Matcha Tea"

It didn't take long for this secret family recipe to earn the title of an 'outlaw brew'...and the name 'Moonshine' was born. Today: with a stripped-down, no frills attitude, Moonshine Sweat Tea's six delicious flavors are still brewed in the same honest-to-God fashion - one batch at a time - with the same bold standards that have governed the State of Texas for decades. Hand-crafted with the perfect combination of organic black tea leaves, clean filtered water and 100% pure cane sugar--Moonshine is the original Texas Sweet Tea.","functional beverages, herbal teas, kosher/parve products, organic beverages/juices, tea",
